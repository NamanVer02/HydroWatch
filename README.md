# HydroWatch

Welcome to HydroWatch! This project monitors the contents of the nutrient solution in realtime and enable the user to change the contents even from a remote location.

## Description

This project allows a user to monitor and alter a Hydroponics farm in realtime even from a remote location. 
To ensure the best possible conditions for the growth of the plants, we use the respective sensors to monitor the -
1) pH Level of the nutrient solution
2) Temperature of the environment
3) Total Dissolved Salts (TDS) of the nutrient solution

We also made a website to showcase the current pH, temoerature and the TDS of the hydroponics farm.

## Problem Statement

Even though hydroponics farms have numerous advantages over conventional farming like having a greater yield and optimal use of nutrients and location, they are not popular because the maintainance and monitoring costs are very high and time consuming. Plants growing in hydroponic farming are more sensitive to changes and therefore the nutrient solution has to be monitored frequently and may require tweaking if the plants' growth is not as desired.

This monitoring of the nutrient soltuion can be acheived using sensors and an arduino board and this data can be showed to the user through a website and even an app. Moreover we can create a database which stores the data of each hydroponic farm of the user and help them gain insights into their farming methods and results.

## How to Use

1) We first place the pH sensor and the TDS sensor into the nutrient solution and place the temperature sensor nearby.
2) Then connect the sensors and the Wifi module to the Arduino board.
3) Load the Arduino code and run.
4) The Arduino board continuously records the data and sends it to the website which can be accessed by the user.
