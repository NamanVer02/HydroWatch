HydroWatch is a hydroponic system monitoring service that leverages technology to optimize plant growth and minimize crop failure risks. Through real-time data collection and analysis, HydroWatch provides actionable insights to growers, helping them make informed decisions and prevent crop losses. With the potential to revolutionize indoor plant cultivation, HydroWatch promises to improve produce quality and yield while reducing manual monitoring efforts and costs for growers.


## Problem Statement

Hydroponics, despite its potential for efficient and sustainable plant cultivation, often faces challenges when it comes to monitoring and setting up the system on a commercial scale. Traditional hydroponic systems require meticulous monitoring of parameters such as TDS, pH, and temperature, which can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. This can result in suboptimal plant growth, reduced yields, and increased risk of crop failure.


## Description

HydroWatch is an innovative hydroponic system monitoring service that employs state-of-the-art technology to optimize plant growth in indoor environments. The system utilizes three key sensors - TDS sensor, pH sensor, and temperature sensor - which are all integrated with an Arduino microcontroller for precise and automated monitoring of critical parameters.

The TDS sensor measures the concentration of dissolved nutrients in the water, providing insights into nutrient levels and ensuring optimal nutrition for plants. The pH sensor measures the acidity or alkalinity of the water, helping maintain the ideal pH range for hydroponic plants. The temperature sensor monitors the ambient temperature, ensuring that the growing environment remains within the optimal temperature range for plant growth.

All the sensor data is collected in real-time and transmitted to a cloud-based server for analysis. The system employs machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and provide growers with actionable insights on nutrient adjustments, pH balancing, and temperature control to optimize plant growth.
